## System Architecture

Since the repository is in its early stages with minimal content, specific architectural decisions have not yet been implemented. The project appears to be a blank slate ready for development of an operating system or OS-interface application.

Key considerations for future architecture:
- **Frontend Framework**: No frontend framework has been selected yet
- **Backend Structure**: No backend architecture is currently defined
- **Core OS Components**: System-level components and interfaces are yet to be designed
- **User Interface**: UI/UX patterns and design system are not yet established
- **File System**: File management and storage architecture is not yet implemented
- **Process Management**: Application and process handling mechanisms are undefined

## External Dependencies

Currently, no external dependencies, third-party services, or integrations have been identified in the repository. Future development may require:
- **Development Framework**: Choice of web technologies (React, Vue, etc.) or native development tools
- **Backend Services**: Database solutions, authentication services, and API frameworks
- **System Libraries**: OS-level APIs and system integration libraries
- **UI Components**: Design system libraries and component frameworks
